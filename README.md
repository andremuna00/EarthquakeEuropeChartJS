# 🌍 Earthquake Visualization in Europe  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35fe8d76-7da2-4330-b7d8-ba7494cda73d)

An interactive project to visualize major earthquakes in Europe. This project leverages plain JavaScript `setTimeout` functions and Chart.js to display earthquake data dynamically. Circles appear after a delay, and their size corresponds to the magnitude of each earthquake.

## ✨ Features  

- Dynamically display earthquake data using timeouts  
- Visual representation of earthquake magnitudes as circles  
- Larger circles for higher magnitudes  
- Smooth animations and transitions  
- Interactive and responsive design with Chart.js

## 💡 Learning Outcomes  

- Mastering the use of `setTimeout` for timed events  
- Understanding how to map data (e.g., earthquake magnitudes) to visual representations  
- Working with Chart.js to create dynamic and responsive charts  
- Managing asynchronous events and animations in plain JavaScript  

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Data Input**: The project starts with predefined data about major earthquakes in Europe, including location and magnitude.  
2. **Dynamic Display**: Using JavaScript `setTimeout`, circles appear on the screen after a delay, one at a time.  
3. **Magnitude Representation**: The size of each circle is proportional to the earthquake’s magnitude.  
4. **Chart.js Integration**: A bar or line chart displays earthquake magnitudes and their locations for better comparison.
